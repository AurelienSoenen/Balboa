# Balboa
 

### simu_balboa.m and simu_balboa.py: 

Both documents compile the same algorithm, one in matlab, the other in python. The python code compiles much faster and is more optimised.

-> It simulates the movement of the Balboa from a list of voltages and compares it with the real data. In the folder plot you can find the results of the algorithm.

### respons_balboa.m : 

-> compiles with the same equation the response of the balboa given an initial state.

### Arduino IDE Folder:

-> Different files to implement the balancing robot with physical equations. Mainly the balance() function is modified compared to the original code.
